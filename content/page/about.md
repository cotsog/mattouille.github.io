Much of my late career has been around working in reliability, automation, and operations. I currently work at a start-up called [Capstone Metering](http://capstonemetering.com) where I lead our Software Engineering department.

In my work life I subscribe to many [extreme programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) philosophies and aim to empower teams of both software and systems engineers. I like to use code to make my life either more simple or enjoyable, sometimes nailing both at the same time. I pride myself in being very unselective about tools and rather more of the opinion that there's the right tool or language for the task at hand.

Outside of my professional life I do enjoy coding in my off-time, however, usually this revolves around some sort of home automation. I enjoy traveling to conferences, sharing my perspective, and listening to others.

Her name is Peach. I like seeing new places, in or out of the country, and experiencing different ways of life.

If you're interested in having me speak or put on a workshop at your conference or meet up then I'd most likely be happy to. Below are some of the topics I'm currently interested in:

* Kubernetes
* Enhancing feedback loops
* IOT Management and analytics with distributed systems
* Monitoring and logging aggregation
* Managing operations teams
